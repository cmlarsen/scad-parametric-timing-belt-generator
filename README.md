# scad-parametric-timing-belt-generator
Generates STL or DWF files for a wide variety of timing belts

This is primarily based on https://www.youmagine.com/designs/parametric-timing-belt-generator but adds support for generating a 2d profile you export as a DXF or a 3d STL for directy printing or using in your model.

Examples for how to use it are in the source code. It is pretty simple and just requires changing a few values to meet your needs.

### As a 3d model:

## What is SCAD?

It' basically a little CAD app that runs scripts to generate files. It is useful for creating universal parametric designs to that can be easily imported into your primary CAD software.

You can download SCAD here (supports Mac and PC): https://openscad.org
